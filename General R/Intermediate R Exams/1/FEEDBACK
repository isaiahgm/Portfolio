Core Function (8/10)
You sampled H0 correctly, and did it concisely! Good job. 
However, you should use the alternative probabilities in the sample() function when 
sampling under the alternative. This affects your power calculation.
Critical Value (3/4)
You don't need to add 1, you just need to add a small enough values for the type I error 
rate to be less than or equal to alpha. Additionally, the critical value is only calculated under Ho
P-value (4/6)
It would be correct to use pchisq() if we were not doing a monte carlo study. Use your simulated values to calculate the p-value.
Power (6)
You set it up right, but the output is off because of previously mentioned issues.
Coding Rules (2)
I like the comments. When making a vector for a confidence interval, 
I would not use cbind(), as it is just a one-dimensional object. Just use c() and make a vector
