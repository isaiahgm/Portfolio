From the study it is apparent that alternating the proportion of cars in our cereal boxes will not significantly change the difficulty
of collecting every model of car. Therefore, it is probably not worth the effort to change the likelihood and just go as is. Currently,
it is expected to take approximately 12 boxes for any customer to aquire every car and it is unlikely that anyone will need to buy more
than 14.
