Assignment #2
Your task is to find the netflix users that are most like a given user. Given a netflix user-id find the users that have rated movies the same as the given user. Output those that have rated the most movies like the given user. First output all users that have ranked a movie the same as the given user. Then you will need to reduce that data to indicate the user-id and the number of movies they ranked the same as the given user. You will find the data in /fslgroup/fslg_hadoop/netflix_data.txt. This problem may need multiple map-reduce steps. There are similarities between wordcount and the reverse index map-reduce programs we have looked at in class.watch full movie Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2

The netflix data is stored at /fslgroup/fslg_hadoop/netflix_data.txt.
It is a 1.2 GB file with userIDs, movieIDs, and what the user ranked the movie (1-5).
The format the data is stored in is:
